# Authentication Plan for Stutra Student Tracking System

## Overview
This document outlines the authentication strategy for the Stutra application to ensure secure access control for teachers, administrators, and different user roles.

## Current State
- **No Authentication**: Currently, the app is accessible to anyone with the URL
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Using test mode (public read/write access)
- **Single User Experience**: All users see and can modify the same data

## Proposed Authentication Architecture

### 1. User Roles & Permissions

#### **Administrator (School Admin)**
- **Permissions**: Full access to all features
- **Capabilities**:
  - Add/edit/delete students across all sections
  - Manage teacher accounts
  - Export attendance data for all sections
  - Reset all student statuses
  - View system analytics and reports
  - Configure system settings (timer durations, activity types)

#### **Teacher (Section Teacher)**
- **Permissions**: Limited to assigned sections
- **Capabilities**:
  - View and manage students in assigned sections only
  - Mark attendance and manage student status
  - Add notes to students in their sections
  - Export attendance data for their sections
  - Reset student statuses in their sections

#### **Substitute Teacher**
- **Permissions**: Temporary access to specific sections
- **Capabilities**:
  - View students in assigned sections
  - Mark attendance (read-only notes)
  - Limited export capabilities
  - Cannot reset student data

#### **Observer (Principal/Coordinator)**
- **Permissions**: Read-only access
- **Capabilities**:
  - View real-time attendance across all sections
  - Export attendance reports
  - Cannot modify student statuses or notes

### 2. Authentication Methods

#### **Primary: Firebase Authentication**
- **Email/Password**: For teacher and admin accounts
- **Google Sign-In**: Integrate with school Google Workspace
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Optional for enhanced security

#### **Secondary: Access Codes**
- **Section-specific codes**: For quick access without full registration
- **Time-limited access**: Codes expire after specified periods
- **Guest access**: For substitute teachers or visitors

### 3. Database Security Rules

#### **Firebase Security Rules Structure**
```javascript
{
  "rules": {
    "students": {
      "$studentId": {
        ".read": "auth != null && (
          root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() == 'admin' ||
          root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('sections').hasChild(data.child('section').val())
        )",
        ".write": "auth != null && (
          root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() == 'admin' ||
          (root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('sections').hasChild(data.child('section').val()) &&
           root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() != 'observer')
        )"
      }
    },
    "attendance_logs": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null && root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() != 'observer'"
    },
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid",
        ".write": "auth != null && (
          auth.uid == $uid ||
          root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() == 'admin'
        )"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Implementation Phases

#### **Phase 1: Basic Authentication (Week 1-2)**
- Implement Firebase Authentication
- Create login/signup pages
- Add role-based access control
- Implement basic security rules

#### **Phase 2: User Management (Week 3)**
- Admin dashboard for user management
- Teacher registration workflow
- Section assignment interface
- Password reset functionality

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4)**
- Multi-factor authentication
- Google Workspace integration
- Access code system
- Session management and auto-logout

#### **Phase 4: Audit & Logging (Week 5)**
- Activity logging
- Security audit trails
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Data access logs

### 5. User Management System

#### **User Profile Structure**
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'teacher' | 'substitute' | 'observer';
  sections: string[]; // Assigned sections
  permissions: {
    canEditStudents: boolean;
    canExportData: boolean;
    canResetStatus: boolean;
    canManageNotes: boolean;
  };
  lastLogin: timestamp;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: timestamp;
  updatedAt: timestamp;
}
```

#### **Registration Workflow**
1. **Admin Registration**: 
   - First user becomes admin automatically
   - Subsequent admins must be created by existing admin

2. **Teacher Registration**:
   - Admin creates teacher account with email
   - Teacher receives invitation email
   - Teacher completes profile setup
   - Admin assigns sections to teacher

3. **Access Code System**:
   - Admin generates time-limited access codes
   - Codes can be section-specific or general
   - No permanent account created for code users

### 6. Security Considerations

#### **Data Protection**
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary user information
- **Regular Backups**: Automated daily backups with encryption
- **Access Logs**: Track all data access and modifications

#### **Authentication Security**
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout after failed attempts
- **Device Registration**: Optional device-specific authentication

#### **GDPR/Privacy Compliance**
- **Consent Management**: Clear consent for data processing
- **Data Portability**: Users can export their data
- **Right to Deletion**: Ability to permanently delete accounts
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular privacy settings

### 7. User Interface Changes

#### **Login Screen**
- Clean, school-branded login interface
- Options for email/password and Google sign-in
- "Quick Access" option for access codes
- Password reset functionality

#### **Dashboard Enhancements**
