# Multi-Section Student Storage - Simple Implementation

## Overview

Update the current database to support:
1. **Multiple sections per student** - Students can belong to multiple sections
2. **Teacher access control** - Teachers only see students from their assigned sections

## Current Structure Update

### Students Collection (Modified)
```json
{
  "students": {
    "studentId": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "admissionNumber": "2024001", 
      "sections": ["section1", "section2"],  // Array instead of single section
      "photoUrl": "...",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Sections Collection (New)
```json
{
  "sections": {
    "section1": {
      "name": "Section A",
      "teachers": ["teacherId1", "teacherId2"],  // Teachers assigned to this section
      "students": ["studentId1", "studentId2"]   // Students in this section
    }
  }
}
```

### Teachers Collection (New)
```json
{
  "teachers": {
    "teacherId": {
      "name": "Teacher Name",
      "email": "teacher@school.com",
      "assignedSections": ["section1", "section2"]  // Sections this teacher can access
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Student Structure
- Change `section` field to `sections` array
- Keep existing student data, just modify structure

### Step 2: Create Sections Collection
- Add section definitions
- Link teachers to sections
- Link students to sections

### Step 3: Add Teacher Access Control
- Teachers can only query students from their assigned sections
- Filter all student operations by teacher's section access

## Access Control Rules

```typescript
// Teachers can only see students from their assigned sections
const getStudentsForTeacher = (teacherId: string) => {
  const teacherSections = getTeacherSections(teacherId);
  return getStudentsBySections(teacherSections);
};
```
4. **Inconsistency Risk**: Different sections might have outdated information for the same student
5. **Limited Flexibility**: Cannot handle complex academic structures (electives, mixed classes, etc.)

## Proposed New Structure

### Enhanced Student Data Model
```json
{
  "students": {
    "studentId": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "admissionNumber": "2024001",

      "primarySection": "A",  // Main/home section for administrative purposes
      "photoUrl": "...",
      "personalInfo": {
        "dateOfBirth": "2010-05-15",
        "parentContact": "+91-9876543210",
        "address": "123 Main Street"
      },
      "academicInfo": {
        "enrollmentDate": "2024-01-15",
        "currentGrade": "5th",

      "schedule": {
        "days": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"],
        "startTime": "09:00",

      },
      "metadata": {

        "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "academicYear": "2024-25"
      }
    }
  },
  "student_sections": {
    "relationId": {
      "studentId": "studentId",
      "sectionId": "sectionId",
      "role": "student",  // student, monitor, representative
      "joinDate": "2024-01-15",
      "status": "active",  // active, inactive, completed
      "performance": {
        "attendanceRate": 95.5,
        "lastAttendance": "2024-01-27",
        "totalClasses": 150,
        "attendedClasses": 143
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### New API Endpoints
```typescript
// Section Management
GET /sections - List all sections
POST /sections - Create new section
PUT /sections/{id} - Update section
DELETE /sections/{id} - Remove section

// Student-Section Management  
POST /students/{id}/sections - Add student to section
DELETE /students/{id}/sections/{sectionId} - Remove student from section
GET /sections/{id}/students - Get all students in section
```

### Updated TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
interface Student {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  admissionNumber: string;
  sections: string[];  // Array of section IDs
  primarySection: string;  // Primary section ID
  photoUrl?: string;
  personalInfo: PersonalInfo;
  academicInfo: AcademicInfo;
  metadata: Metadata;
}

interface Section {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  grade: string;
  teacher: string;
  subject: string;
  students: string[];  // Array of student IDs
  schedule: SectionSchedule;
  metadata: Metadata;
}

interface StudentSection {
  id: string;
  studentId: string;
  sectionId: string;
  role: 'student' | 'monitor' | 'representative';
  joinDate: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'completed';
  performance: PerformanceMetrics;
}
```

### Database Manager Enhancements
```bash
# New commands for section management
python db_manager.py add-section --name "Section A" --grade "5th" --teacher "teacherId"
python db_manager.py list-sections
python db_manager.py assign-student --student "studentId" --section "sectionId"
python db_manager.py remove-student-from-section --student "studentId" --section "sectionId"

# Migration commands
python db_manager.py migrate-to-multisection
python db_manager.py rollback-migration
python db_manager.py validate-migration
```
