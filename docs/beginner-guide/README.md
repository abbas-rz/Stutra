## 💡 Key Concepts

Before diving in, here are some important concepts:

### What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Think of it like LEGO blocks - you build small pieces (components) and put them together to make a website.

### What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is like JavaScript but with extra rules that help prevent bugs. It tells you what type of data each variable should contain (text, numbers, etc.).

### What is Material-UI?
Material-UI is a collection of pre-made, beautiful components (buttons, forms, etc.) that follow Google's design guidelines.

### What is Firebase?
Firebase is Google's service that provides a database and user authentication (login system) for web apps.
